1. Update ...

### Questions to ask 18F owner: 

* Can we correctly call the data license CC0?  
* Is the PoC correct?  
* When was the underlying data last modified? 
* How often is the underlying data updated? 
* ...


### Other Notes

For the data working group (?)  

1. Adding some of our datasets to GSA's data inventory 
2. Memorializing the workflow for when we announce future datasets (e.g. the upcoming subdomain list).


For (1):
* Skim through all 18F projects and brainstorm what data (flat or API) we have created, manage, or are otherwise responsible for.  Add ideas [here](https://github.com/18F/data-inventory/issues/1).
