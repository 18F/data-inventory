1. Update ...


### Other Notes

For the data working group (?)  

1. Adding some of our datasets to GSA's data inventory 
2. Memorializing the workflow for when we announce future datasets (e.g. the upcoming subdomain list).


For (1):
* Skim through all 18F projects and brainstorm what data (flat or API) we have created, manage, or are otherwise responsible for.  Add ideas [here](https://github.com/18F/data-inventory/issues/1).
