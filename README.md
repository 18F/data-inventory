18F owns, generates, or manages several datasets at GSA.  In support of the [Open Data Policy](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/), we want to ensure that they are appropriately included in the agency's data catalogs.  This ensures that agency staff, other agencies, and the public can find this information as easily as possible.  

The metadata for these datasets is managed this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGmO6jLpuATNW2Xx3oYLSaKClFSvfTVxWhQ7LCpFP1A/edit#gid=0), to be regularly submitted to GSA's data team for incorporation into the agency's enterprise data inventory and [public data listing](http://www.gsa.gov/data.json).  

* The most up to date information is in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QGmO6jLpuATNW2Xx3oYLSaKClFSvfTVxWhQ7LCpFP1A/edit#gid=0).
* More information on the metadata schema used [can be found here](https://project-open-data.cio.gov/v1.1/schema/).
* Are we missing a dataset?  [Let us know](https://github.com/18F/data-inventory/issues/1)!
* Our POC for this at GSA are cindya.smith@gsa.gov, joseph.castle@gsa.gov
